# Fake-News-Classifier



Project Completed: Fake News Classifier (NLP + Machine Learning)

I built a Fake News Detection Model using Python, NLP, and ML techniques to classify news articles as FAKE or REAL.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Achieved 99% accuracy using SVM with TF-IDF

Compared 3 ML models: Passive Aggressive, Logistic Regression, and SVM

Performed GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning

Built WordCloud visualizations to analyze fake vs real news patterns

Implemented Pickle model saving for easy deployment

Dataset used: Fake.csv + True.csv

🛠 Tech Stack:

Python · Sklearn · NLP · TF-IDF · Seaborn · Matplotlib · GridSearchCV · Pickle

Proud of how this turned out — excited to build more NLP-based ML applications! 🚀
